// Guided Tour configuration — one array of "sub-steps" per pipeline step id.
// Each sub-step can:
//   - just point at an element and explain it (informational), or
//   - require the user to actually perform an action before the tour moves on
//     (requireAction: true + check(ctx) => boolean), showing a red
//     "Action Required" tooltip until the condition becomes true, then
//     auto-advancing.
//
// Shape of a sub-step:
// {
//   title: string,
//   target: ".cssSelector" | null,      // element to highlight + anchor to (null = centered)
//   body: string,                        // shown (and spoken) once satisfied
//   requireAction?: true,
//   check?: (ctx) => boolean,            // ctx = the useMatrix() context value
//   waitingTarget?: ".cssSelector",      // element to anchor to while NOT satisfied
//   waitingBody?: string,                // shown (and spoken) while NOT satisfied
// }
//
// To add a tour for another pipeline step, add a new `<id>: [ ... ]` entry
// below — nothing else needs to change, GuidedTour.jsx reads this file.
